**TrajectoryCollectionAggregator** generalizes and aggregates trajectories by extracting
clusters of significant trajectory points and computing flows between the clusters.
It is based on an algorithm by Andrienko & Andrienko (2011) as described in
https://anitagraser.com/2016/11/07/movement-data-in-gis-3-visualizing-massive-trajectory-datasets/.
